## Overview of the statistical analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to explore Tableau, a data analysis and visualization tool. It allows data visualization professionals to create assests that are visually appealling and easy for a nontechnical audience or stakeholder to understand. 

## Results

i) Checkout Times for Users: We analyze the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders.

![Graph 1 - Checkout Times for Users](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111898553/211167180-8b6923c8-6aad-44c0-b2fd-36df3c1d9cf9.PNG)

Most bike ridies occur in the first 20 minutes and then experiece a downward growth until the first hour.

ii) Checkout Times by Gender: We analyse the length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender.

As we can see in the graph above, male rides use this service by a lot more than females.

iii) Trips by weekday for Each Hour: We graph the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as follows:

Bike rides are most popular, used during rush hours as 8AM and between 5PM and 6PM. Thursday is the busiest weekday.

iv) Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour): We graph the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as follows:

As previously mentioned, males use the bike sharing more often (darker orange in the male section). They use it more during rush hour and during the weekday.

v) User Trips by Gender by Weekday: We visualize the number of bike trips by gender for each hour for each day of the week as follows:

Subscribers use the bike sharing service more often. It is more used by males and mostly on Thursday's and Friday's.

## Summary

The data analysis done showed that a bike sharing service is used more by male subscribers during rush hours.
